Stretch Questions

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
     The width is the system with which elements interact with eachother and the viewport. The fix is to change all elements in your page to "box-sizing: border-box", this whay the width you provide will measure up until the border.
     and you wont have to calculate the border and padding in every element.
